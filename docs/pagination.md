# Pagination

::: tip Note
This feature has yet to be implemented. Please be patient as we add the features from v2.
:::

For any of our endpoints that returns an array, you may use query string params to filter out data you don't need.

Name | Data Type | Required / Optional | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`max` | number | optional | Amount of results to return (if available)
`page` | string | optional | Page to start from (zero-based)

## Examples
Endpoint | Data returned
--- | ---
`/clan/search?name=xxx` | `[a, b, c, d, e, f]`    
`/clan/search?name=xxx&max=2` |`[a, b]`
`/clan/search?name=xxx&max=2&page=1` | `[c, d]`
`/clan/search?name=xxx&max=3&page=1` | `[d, e, f]`
