<img width="30%" height="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cr-api/cr-api-docs/master/docs/img/cr-api-logo-b.png">

Welcome to RoyaleAPI, the unofficial public API for Clash Royale! You can use our API to access Clash Royale API endpoints, which provides real-time information about players, clans, clan wars, tournaments and more.

::: tip Note
We have sunsetted our public API starting on March 1st, 2020. Our website for end users will not be affected. Please [read our blog post](https://royaleapi.com/blog/sunset-api) for full details.

::: tip Proxy IP Update 2022-02-08
Supercell made some changes with how tokens are handled. Because of this, the  [proxy](/proxy) will no longer work with `128.128.128.128` but you can create a new key with `45.79.218.79`.
::: 

You can see implementations of this API in [Showcase](/showcase) by third-party developers and on our web site: https://royaleapi.com

[Wrappers](/wrappers) in multiple languages are also available.

If you are new to development using REST APIs, we recommend that you try out [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), which provides many useful tools for your daily development needs.

If you find this API useful, please consider [donating](/donate) so we can continue to provide this service free of charge to everyone. 

::: tip Note
The JSON structure may change over time. Please follow our [Twitter @RoyaleAPI](https://twitter.com/RoyaleAPI) or join our [Discord](https://discord.royaleapi.dev) server for important updates.
