# RoyaleAPI Developers

This is an archive of our original public API documentation. We created our API and made it publically available to everyone free of charge in 2017, before sunsetting in 2020.

A detailed history about our API and the reason why we have discontinued it here can be read on our blog post titled [Discontinuing API service for developers — Will not affect website](https://royaleapi.com/blog/sunset-api) published on January 24, 2020.

We kept this online documentation as an archive of what we have done in the past. As we no longer provide a public API, you won’t be able to get a developer key anymore. If you’re looking to developer an application for Clash Royale, please use the [Official Clash Royale API from Supercell](https://developer.clashroyale.com).
