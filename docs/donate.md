# Donation

We operate our API as a free service to the Clash Royale community, and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future.

Per [Supercell fan policy](https://supercell.com/en/fan-content-policy/), we are only allowed to utilize advertising or donations to cover our costs. However, as an API service, we cannot support our costs through advertising, nor can we provide tier-based service. As such, your generous donation is very much appreciated!

After you have made your donation, please DM (direct-message) SML on Discord and provide the following information:

- **Name** to display on our [Patron](https://royaleapi.com/donate) list.
- **Player tag** if you would like to link to your profile.

Additionally, you will gain access to the special `#patron` channel and a highlighted role on Discord.
