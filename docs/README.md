# Introduction

<img width="30%" height="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cr-api/cr-api-docs/master/docs/img/cr-api-logo-b.png">

Welcome to RoyaleAPI, the unofficial public API for Clash Royale! You can use our API to access Clash Royale API endpoints, which provides real-time information about players, clans, clan wars, tournaments and more.

You can see implementations of this API in [Showcase](/showcase) by third-party developers and on our web site: https://royaleapi.com

[Wrappers](/wrappers) in multiple languages are also available.

If you are new to development using REST APIs, we recommend that you try out [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), which provides many useful tools for your daily development needs.

If you find this API useful, please consider [donating](/donate) so we can continue to provide this service free of charge to everyone. 

!> We are currently in alpha pre-release. The JSON structure may change over time. Please follow our [Twitter @RoyaleAPI](https://twitter.com/RoyaleAPI) or join our [Discord](https://discord.me/RoyaleAPI) server for important updates.
