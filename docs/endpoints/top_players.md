# Get Top Players

::: tip Note
This endpoint has yet to support Global leaderboards. Please be patient as we add the endpoints from v2. The endpoint will return a 404 Not Found error when not provided a location key.
:::

This endpoint retrieves the Global 200 top players on the leaderboard. Data is cached and currently set to update every 10 minutes.

You may want to use [pagination](pagination) for this request.

## HTTP Request

`https://api.royaleapi.com/top/players/<LOCATION_KEY>`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
`LOCATION_KEY` | two-letter code of the location. Omit the `LOCATION_KEY` to get the global leaderboard.

 See [cr-api-data/json/regions.json](https://github.com/RoyaleAPI/cr-api-data/blob/master/json/regions.json) for the full list of acceptable keys.

 ::: tip Note
Unlike clans, players do not belong to regions (denoted by `_` underscore prefix). Players only belong to a country. Clans can be set to a region because it is a clan setting.
