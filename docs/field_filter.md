# Filtering Fields

::: tip Note
This feature has yet to be implemented. Please be patient as we add the features from v2.
:::

For any of our endpoints, you may use query string params to optionally include or exclude fields that you don‚Äôt need.

Name | Data Type | Required / Optional | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`keys` | string | optional | Comma-separated included fields.
`exclude` | string | optional | Comma-separated excluded fields.

Only top-level fields are supported at the moment, but filtering lower-level fields e.g. receiving card keys inside a deck but without their full descriptions, is planned and may be implemented in the future. 

## Examples

If you just want the name and tag of a player, you may request the following:

`https://api.royaleapi.com/player/C0G20PR2?keys=name,tag`

Response:

```json
{
    "tag": "C0G20PR2",
    "name": "SML"
}
```

If you want to get the clan information without loading the member list:

`https://api.royaleapi.com/clan/2CCCP?exclude=members`

Response:

```json
{
    "tag": "2CCCP",
    "name": "Reddit Alpha",
    "description": "5500üèÜ PB to join. When full, #50/50 sent to Reddit Bravo #2U2GGQJ üöÄhttps://discord.gg/RACF üöÄhttps://twitch.tv/woody",
